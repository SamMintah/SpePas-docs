In SpePas, multi-vendor support allows sellers to register their shops and manage their inventory through the admin portal. Follow the steps below to register a new seller.

### Mutation

Use the `RegisterSeller` mutation to register a new seller. Provide details such as the shop name, seller's first and last name, email address, and password.

```graphql
mutation RegisterSeller {
  registerNewSeller(
    input: {
      shopName: "new Sam' on Render SP"
      seller: {
        firstName: "san"
        lastName: "Kay"
        emailAddress: "test.seller@example.com"
        password: "test"
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    createdAt
    seller {

    }
  }
}
```

### Usage Notes

## Add Payment to Order

To handle payments for orders in SpePas, utilize the `addPaymentToOrder` mutation. This mutation allows you to associate a payment method with an order.

### Mutation

Execute the following GraphQL mutation to add a payment to an order:

```graphql

mutation {
  addPaymentToOrder(
    input: { method: "connected-payment-method", metadata: {} }
  ) {
    ... on Order {
      id
    }
    ... on ErrorResult {
      errorCode
      message
    }
    ... on PaymentFailedError {
      paymentErrorMessage
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage Notes

- The `addPaymentToOrder` mutation associates the specified payment method with the order.
- Check the response to determine the success or failure of the payment addition.

- Errors or payment failures are communicated through the relevant fields in the response.

This mutation is crucial for managing the financial aspects of orders within the SpePas e-commerce platform.
