### Sample Mutation

Execute the following GraphQL mutation to create a new account:

```graphql
mutation {
  createAccount(
    input: {
      firstName: "Sall"
      lastName: "sample"
      email: "sample@email.com"
      Phone: "022337544"
      password: "pass122"
    }
  ) {
    id
    email
    firstName
    lastName
    createdAt
  }
}
```

### Test Environment

Visit the SpePas Shop API endpoint to perform account creation tests:

<aside class="notice">
The <code>createAccount</code>  mutation returns the <code>id</code> of the newly created account, along with the provided <code>email</code>, <code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>, and the timestamp of the account's creation <code>createdAt</code>.
</aside>

Learn more from [**Auth**](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/core-concepts/auth/#customer-auth)

### Expected Response

Upon a successful account creation, the API will respond with the newly created account details:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createAccount": {
      "id": "5",
      "email": "sample@email.com",
      "firstName": "Sall",
      "lastName": "sample",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-27T04:52:09.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

# User Authentication: Custom Login

To authenticate a user and obtain an authentication token, use the `customLogin` mutation. This mutation requires the user's identifier (email or phone number) and password.

## Sample Mutation

Execute the following GraphQL mutation to perform a custom login:

```graphql
mutation {
  customLogin(input: { identifier: "0536369414", password: "newpassword" }) {
    token
    user {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
      email
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Notes

- The `customLogin` mutation returns an authentication token (`token`) and user details (`user`) upon successful login.
- Provide the user's identifier (email or phone number) and password in the mutation input.
- The user details include the user's ID (`id`), first name (`firstName`), last name (`lastName`), and email address (`email`).

## Expected Response

Upon successful authentication, the API will respond with the authentication token and user details:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "customLogin": {
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjUiLCJpYXQiOjE3MDcwOTU0MjIsImV4cCI6MTcwNzcwMDIyMn0.NRv85gsObfOowpFyqcZlpLMSdrz7Vpitwo-c6T0J-Pw",
      "user": {
        "id": "5",
        "firstName": null,
        "lastName": null,
        "email": "km.graphicz1@gmail.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<aside class="notice">
The user's first name (`firstName`) and last name (`lastName`) may appear as null in this example. Ensure that your user data includes these details for a complete user profile.
</aside>

## Token Usage

Use the obtained authentication token (`token`) in the `Authorization` header of your GraphQL requests to authenticate the user and access protected resources.

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjUiLCJpYXQiOjE3MDcwOTU0MjIsImV4cCI6MTcwNzcwMDIyMn0.NRv85gsObfOowpFyqcZlpLMSdrz7Vpitwo-c6T0J-Pw
