# SpePas API Documentation

Welcome to the SpePas API documentation. Read this page to gain a high-level understanding of the API and its key features

## Developer-guide Overview

The SpePas API is built using [**vendure**](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/developer-guide/overview/)
,this doc is tailored to guide developers in integrating the SpePas API with it's mobile app (storefront).

## APIs

Vendure exposes all of its functionality via APIs. Specifically, featuring two GraphQL APIs

[**Shop API**](https://spepas-api.onrender.com/shop-api)

[**Admin API**](https://spepas-api.onrender.com/admin-api/)

# Key Features

1. **Real-Time Interaction:**
   Real-Time Interaction: The API ensures seamless communication by leveraging the SpePas mobile app and server in real-time. This architecture supports instant updates, guaranteeing a dynamic and responsive spare parts shopping experience for your users

2. **GraphQL for Effortless Integration:**
   Streamline data exchange with GraphQL, simplifying communication between the frontend (storefront) and backend. Utilize GraphQL's flexible query language to request specific data, minimizing unnecessary transfers and optimizing the performance of the mobile app.

## Data Exchange Format

3. **Structured Data with GraphQL:**
   Utilize GraphQL for structured and efficient data exchange. Access information with a single, well-defined endpoint, reducing the complexity of data retrieval for frontend developers.

4. **Rich Product Information:**
   Retrieve detailed spare parts information, including part specifications, vendor details, pricing, and availability. Enhance the user experience by showcasing comprehensive product data within the mobile app.

## Authentication and Authorization

5. **Secure User Authentication:**
   Implement secure user registration and login processes. Allow users to access personalized data, such as saved carts and order history, securely.

6. **Social Logins and OTP Support:**
   Facilitate a seamless onboarding experience by integrating social logins. Enhance security with OTP authentication, providing an additional layer of verification for user accounts.

# Customer Account Management

# User Account Creation

To create a user account, initiate the account creation process using the `initiateAccountCreation` mutation. This mutation requires the user's phone number and desired password.

## Sample Mutation

Execute the following GraphQL mutation to initiate the account creation process:

```graphql
mutation getStarted {
  initiateAccountCreation(
    input: { phone: "0201234567890", password: "tryPass" }
  ) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```

![initiate-account](images/signup.png)

## Usage Notes

- The `initiateAccountCreation` mutation initiates the account creation process by sending an OTP (One-Time Password) to the provided phone number.
- Provide the user's phone number and desired password in the mutation input.

## Expected Response

Upon successful initiation of the account creation process, the API will respond with a success message:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "initiateAccountCreation": {
      "success": true,
      "message": "OTP sent successfully"
    }
  }
}
```

## OTP Verification

After initiating the account creation process, a one-time password (OTP) will be sent to the user's phone number. The user needs to verify this OTP to complete the account creation process.

```graphql
mutation {
  verifyOtp(input: { otp: "567633" }) {
    token
  }
}
```

}
```

## Adding Items to Order

To add items to the order from different sellers, utilize the `addItemToOrder` mutation. This mutation allows customers to specify the product variant ID and quantity for each item they want to purchase.

## Sample Mutation

Execute the following GraphQL mutation to add items to the order:

```graphql
mutation {
  addItemToOrder(productVariantId: "56", quantity: 1) {
    __typename
    ... on Order {
      id
    }
    ... on ErrorResult {
      errorCode
    }
  }
  add2: addItemToOrder(productVariantId: "58", quantity: 1) {
    __typename
    ... on Order {
      id
    }
    ... on ErrorResult {
      errorCode
    }
  }
}
```

<aside class="notice">
The <code>addItemToOrder</code> mutation includes the <code>__typename</code> field to differentiate between the order type and potential error results. Check the response for the order ID or error code accordingly.
</aside>

![home](images/addToCart.png) ![setuppassword](images/checkout.png)

## Expected Response

Upon successfully adding items to the order, the API will respond with the order ID:

```json
{

    },
    "add2": {
      "__typename": "Order",
      "id": "4"

## Adding payment to Order

To handle orders in SpePas, utilize the `addPaymentToOrder` mutation. This mutation allows you to associate a payment method with an order.

## Mutation

Execute the following GraphQL mutation to add a payment to an order:

```graphql
mutation {
  addPaymentToOrder(
    input: { method: "connected-payment-method", metadata: {} }

      id
    }
    ... on ErrorResult {
      errorCode
      message
    }
    ... on PaymentFailedError {
      paymentErrorMessage
    }
  }
}
```

![home](images/addPayment.png)

### Usage Notes

- The `addPaymentToOrder` mutation associates the specified payment method with the order.
- Check the response to determine the success or failure of the payment addition.
- The `Order` type includes the `id` field, providing the order ID after a successful payment.
- Errors or payment failures are communicated through the relevant fields in the response.

## Expected Response

The API will respond based on the outcome of the payment addition:

- **Successful Payment:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "addPaymentToOrder": {
      "id": "your_order_id"
    }
  }
}
```

- **Error Result:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "addPaymentToOrder": {
      "errorCode": "your_error_code",
      "message": "error_message"
    }
  }
}
```

- **Payment Failed:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "addPaymentToOrder": {
      "paymentErrorMessage": "payment_error_message"
